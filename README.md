# Welcome to online pong with a shotty back-end

## How it works

You connect to the server, it assigns you to a room, you press space and wait for the game to start

Git Clone the repo and run with `love pong` or however you usually run love based source-code

## How to host your own backend

change the domain/ip and port in the main.lua and client.lua and optionally inside server.lua to your desired values
change conf.lua to false for headless mode
